# Loan-Eligibilty-Prediction
The loan prediction system is a Flask-based web application hosted on GitHub, designed to assist users in predicting the likelihood of their loan applications being approved by financial institutions. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes various factors such as applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, and loan term to generate predictions. Users can input their relevant details through the user interface, and the system processes this information to provide a prediction regarding the approval or rejection of their loan application. The project aims to offer a convenient and accessible tool for individuals seeking insights into their loan approval prospects, thereby aiding them in making informed financial decisions
